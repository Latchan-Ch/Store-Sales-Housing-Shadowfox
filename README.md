This repository contains two intermediate-level Machine Learning projects completed as part of my AI/ML Internship at ShadowFox.
Each project applies real-world datasets to build and analyze predictive models using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Scikit-learn in Google Colab.

 Projects:
1. Store Sales and Profit Analysis
 Objective:
To analyze a retail storeâ€™s sales and profit data to derive actionable business insights that can help improve operations, inventory decisions, and marketing strategies.

 Tools & Libraries:
Python

pandas, matplotlib, seaborn (for data analysis and visualization)

 What I Did:
Loaded the dataset in Google Colab

Performed data cleaning and handled encoding issues

Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Created visualizations like:

Sales by Category

Profit by Region

Top 10 Products by Sales

Profit by Sub-Category

Derived business insights (e.g., loss-making sub-categories)

 2. Boston House Price Prediction
 Objective:
To build a regression model that predicts median housing prices (MEDV) in Boston based on factors such as crime rate, number of rooms, property tax, etc.

ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries:
Python

pandas, seaborn, matplotlib

scikit-learn (for model building and evaluation)

 What I Did:
Loaded the Boston housing dataset

Handled missing values by dropping rows

Used correlation heatmaps to analyze important features

Split data into training and testing sets

Trained a Linear Regression model

Evaluated using:

Mean Squared Error (MSE)

RÂ² Score

Visualized predictions with an Actual vs Predicted scatter plot

ðŸ“‰ Output:
The model provided decent accuracy in predicting house prices
